## Basic Usage

The `visibility` utilities control element visibility. Note that invisible elements do not cause layout to reflow; invisible elements are _invisibly_ rendered. These utilities can also hide rows or columns in a `<table>`.

| Class Name  | Property              |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| `visible`   | `visibility: visible` |
| `invisible` | `visibility: hidden`  |

{.table}

## Default Settings

The following default responsive and pseudo settings.

| Setting      | Default Setting |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| `responsive` | `true`          |
| `pseudos`    | `none`          |

{.table}
